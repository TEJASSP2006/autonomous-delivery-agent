## Abstract

This project implements an autonomous delivery agent that navigates 2D grid environments using multiple pathfinding algorithms. The agent demonstrates rational behavior by optimizing delivery efficiency while handling static obstacles, varying terrain costs, and dynamic moving obstacles. We compare uninformed search (BFS, UCS), informed search (A*), and local search (Hill Climbing) algorithms, along with a dynamic replanning strategy. Experimental results show A* provides the best balance of optimality and efficiency, while dynamic replanning is essential for real-world applications with moving obstacles.

## 1. Introduction

The autonomous delivery problem requires an intelligent agent to navigate complex environments efficiently while adapting to changing conditions. This project addresses the challenge of designing a rational delivery agent that can:

- Model complex 2D grid environments with obstacles and varying terrain
- Choose optimal actions under constraints (time, fuel)  
- Adapt to dynamic changes through replanning
- Compare algorithm performance across different scenarios

The implemented system demonstrates key AI concepts including search algorithms, heuristics, and dynamic adaptation, providing insights into their practical applications in autonomous navigation.

## 2. Environment Model

### 2.1 Grid Representation

The environment is modeled as a 2D grid where each cell has:
- **Cell Type**: Empty, Obstacle, Start, Goal, or Moving Obstacle
- **Movement Cost**: Integer value ≥ 1 representing terrain difficulty
- **Coordinates**: (x, y) position in the grid

### 2.2 Static Elements

**Obstacles**: Impassable cells that block agent movement
**Terrain Costs**: Variable movement costs simulating different terrain types:
- Cost 1: Roads, easy terrain
- Cost 2-3: Moderate terrain (grass, gravel)
- Cost 4-5: Difficult terrain (hills, mud)

### 2.3 Dynamic Elements

**Moving Obstacles**: Represent dynamic elements like other vehicles
- Follow predefined cyclic paths
- Move deterministically with known future positions
- Require replanning when blocking agent's path

### 2.4 Agent Constraints

- **Movement**: 4-connected (up, down, left, right)
- **Fuel Limit**: Maximum distance constraint
- **Rationality**: Must choose actions maximizing delivery efficiency

## 3. Agent Design

### 3.1 Architecture

The delivery agent follows a modular design:

```
DeliveryAgent
├── Environment (grid representation)
├── PathfindingAlgorithms (search strategies)
├── PerformanceMetrics (evaluation)
└── DynamicReplanning (adaptation)
```

### 3.2 Rationality Model

The agent demonstrates rationality by:
- **Goal-directed**: Always seeks shortest path to delivery location
- **Efficiency-focused**: Minimizes path cost under terrain constraints
- **Adaptive**: Replans when environment changes
- **Resource-aware**: Considers fuel/time limitations

### 3.3 Decision Making

Agent decisions follow this priority:
1. **Safety**: Avoid obstacles and invalid moves
2. **Optimality**: Choose minimum cost path when possible
3. **Adaptability**: Replan when blocked by dynamic obstacles
4. **Efficiency**: Balance solution quality with computation time

## 4. Implemented Algorithms

### 4.1 Uninformed Search Methods

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Strategy**: Explore all nodes at current depth before going deeper
- **Optimality**: Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs
- **Complexity**: O(b^d) time and space
- **Use Case**: Simple grids with uniform movement costs

**Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**  
- **Strategy**: Expand nodes in order of path cost
- **Optimality**: Guarantees minimum cost path
- **Complexity**: O(b^⌈C*/ε⌉) where C* is optimal cost
- **Use Case**: Weighted grids requiring optimal solutions

### 4.2 Informed Search Method

**A* Search**
- **Strategy**: Best-first search using f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
- **Heuristic**: Manhattan distance (admissible for 4-connected grids)
- **Optimality**: Guaranteed with admissible heuristic
- **Efficiency**: Optimal in terms of nodes expanded
- **Implementation**: Priority queue with path reconstruction

Heuristic Function:
```
h(n) = |n.x - goal.x| + |n.y - goal.y|
```

**Admissibility Proof**: Manhattan distance never overestimates actual cost in 4-connected grids, ensuring optimality.

### 4.3 Local Search Method

**Hill Climbing with Random Restarts**
- **Strategy**: Greedy local search with multiple starting points
- **Evaluation**: Uses distance to goal as fitness function
- **Restart Mechanism**: Overcomes local optima through randomization
- **Limitation**: No optimality guarantee
- **Advantage**: Low memory usage, fast execution

### 4.4 Dynamic Replanning Strategy

**Dynamic A* with Time-aware Planning**
- **Initial Plan**: Compute optimal path using standard A*
- **Execution Monitoring**: Check for obstacle conflicts at each step
- **Replanning Trigger**: When moving obstacle blocks planned path
- **Recomputation**: A* with time dimension for moving obstacle prediction
- **Logging**: Record all replanning events for analysis
