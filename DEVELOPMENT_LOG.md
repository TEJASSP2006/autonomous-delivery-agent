## Key Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Ensuring A* heuristic admissibility
   **Solution**: Used Manhattan distance for 4-connected grids

2. **Challenge**: Handling dynamic obstacles efficiently
   **Solution**: Implemented time-aware A* with replanning triggers

3. **Challenge**: Creating reproducible experiments
   **Solution**: Used fixed random seeds and standardized test maps

## Technical Decisions

- **Language**: Python for simplicity and rich libraries
- **Movement**: 4-connected (realistic for delivery vehicles)
- **Heuristic**: Manhattan distance (admissible and efficient)
- **Data Format**: JSON for human-readable map files
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib for clear algorithm demonstration
